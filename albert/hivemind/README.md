## Hivemind: decentralized deep learning in PyTorch

This is a version of the [hivemind](https://github.com/learning-at-home/hivemind) library modified so that some peers may be programmed to become Byzantine and perform various types of attacks on the training process. Initially, it was forked from [this](https://github.com/learning-at-home/hivemind/commit/020c068344cb4d72ab09bce0fd4b1322a3c28e9d) commit.
